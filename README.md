|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Email Tracker by Mailtrack®** | Functional, but  **limited transparency** – doesn’t notify recipients of tracking. |
| **Google Translate**      |  Safe for public use, but  **not recommended for sensitive data** like passwords or ID numbers. |
| **McAfee WebAdvisor**     |  Good malware/phishing detection, intrusive UI,  privacy concerns, hard to remove. |
